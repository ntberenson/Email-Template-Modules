# Getting Started

Take the following steps to start building a new email layout.

1. Copy the entire code from the starter template into a new Dreamweaver HTML document and save the file.

2. Select a layout module and copy/paste the module's code block into the body section of your new html file as indicated in the starter template's comments.

3. Once you've placed the component into the document, edit the component's content using Dreamweaver * Live View *

4. When finished with content edits, save your layout and open in Watson.


### Optimization

If Watson appears to not minify/compress emails pre-send, additional optimization may be required. One widely used option is to utilize [htmlcrush](https://htmlcrush.com/) or a similar tool.


### Images

When preparing an image for use in the HeroSection module be sure that the subject of the image is correctly positioned. Utilize this file as an example of image positioning for both 320 & 600 breakpoints. [Example file for cropping & positioning](https://)
